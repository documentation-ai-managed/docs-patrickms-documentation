## API Overview

The Nova Gestion API allows developers to programmatically manage websites, domains, and hosting settings. Built on REST principles, our API provides secure and efficient access to all platform features.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys. Generate your keys in the dashboard under the API settings section.

<Callout kind="danger">Keep your API keys secure and never share them in public repositories.</Callout>

  ```
  ```python
  import requests
  
  headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  
  response = requests.get("https://api.novagestion.eu/v1/websites", headers=headers)
